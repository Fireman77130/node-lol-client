Handler for login queue is wrong

* Mistakes !token as 'no response', but actually is 'in queue'

* It should display that it is in queue, continually retry and update information about the queue

node = login queue ID
champ = Name of login queue
rate = Number of tickets being processed every update
delay = How often the queue updates
id = Our ticket in line
current = Current ticket being processed

So

id - current = Our spot "in line"

Continually send response and check, sleep time = delay, update the ticker

Then continue login process like normal once we retrive a login token.


String champ = result.getString("champ"); // The name of our login queue
			int rate = result.getInt("rate"); // How many tickets are processed every queue update
			int delay = result.getInt("delay"); // How often the queue status updates
			
			int id = 0;
			int cur = 0;
			Object[] tickers = result.getArray("tickers");
			for (Object o : tickers)
			{
				TypedObject to = (TypedObject)o;
				
				// Find our queue
				int tnode = to.getInt("node");
				if (tnode != node)
					continue;
				
				id = to.getInt("id"); // Our ticket in line
				cur = to.getInt("current"); // The current ticket being processed
